# learning-journal-project-4
This was my favourite project so far. I really enjoyed the creative aspect when designing the app.
I also really enjoyed figuring out how to make the flow of the app work.
The hardest part was working out how to use appsheets but I really value this learning process and think I will be able to use it in the future.
I think the timing of the due date was our hardest aspect as a group as we all had alot of assignments due but we managed to sort it all out.
